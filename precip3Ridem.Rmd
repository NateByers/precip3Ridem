In <a href="http://rpubs.com/NateByers/precipRidem" target="_blank">part 1</a>
of this tutorial we tidied up some data from the `IDEMdata` package, and in
<a href="http://rpubs.com/NateByers/precip2Ridem" target="_blank">part 2</a> we 
used that data to create precipitation graphs. In this part we will use functions
and loops to automate the creation of these graphs.
